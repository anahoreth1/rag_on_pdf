# Overview

This project uses the RAG architecture to obtain answers from a dataset of PDF files.

1. The next step is the generation of the test dataset, which will be used to compare the models.

2. RAG System.

3. A UI based on Streamlit is provided to demonstrate the functionality. To run the UI, execute the Streamlit script inside the `src` folder:  
```streamlit run ui.py```


All stages have been tested in the notebook located at  `notebooks/research.ipynb`


# 1. Creating the test dataset

The logic is implemented in the `test_dataset_generation`.py script. This script generates a test dataset for evaluating RAG systems using the Google Gemini API. It processes PDF documents, extracts their text, and prompts Gemini to produce factual questionâ€“answer pairs strictly from each page. The output is cleaned, converted to JSON format, and saved as a `.csv` file (`TEST_DATA_CSV`).


# 2. RAG System

TBA

# 3. UI 

The UI provides a simple way to test the functionality locally.
Streamlit script is used.
